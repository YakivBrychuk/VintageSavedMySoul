### Revenue Model

1.  **Direct Sales**: Each preloved or handmade piece is sold directly to consumers.
2.  **Feature Listings**: Artisans or sellers can pay to have specific items featured.
3.  **Add-on Services**: Potential add-ons include custom fitting or small alterations.

### Marketing Strategies

**Online Marketing**

1.  **SEO**: Targeted keywords like ‚Äúvintage fashion,‚Äù ‚Äúhandmade clothing,‚Äù and ‚Äúpreloved items‚Äù to rank higher on search engines.
2.  **Social Media**: Focus on Instagram for visually engaging vintage content, plus Facebook for community building.
3.  **Influencer Collaborations**: Work with vintage stylists, local artisans, and sustainable living influencers.

**Offline Marketing**

1.  **Local Vintage Fairs**: Showcase curated items at fairs to engage face-to-face with potential customers.
